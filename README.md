# **Earthquake Magnitude Prediction**

## This project involves developing a predictive model for earthquake magnitudes using an XGBoost model. The model takes three input fields: latitude, longitude, and mean sea level, and outputs the predicted magnitude of the earthquake.

# Features
## Accurate Predictions: Utilizes the powerful XGBoost algorithm to provide accurate earthquake magnitude predictions.
## Easy to Use: Simple input interface requiring only latitude, longitude, and mean sea level.
## Scalable: Can be easily integrated into larger systems for real-time predictions and analysis.
